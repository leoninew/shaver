## Overview

This project designed to automatically generate Java, C#, YAML, and MySQL definitions by parsing JSON data structures. It simplifies the manual effort required by developers working across various platforms, enhancing development efficiency while ensuring data structure consistency and accuracy.

## Key Features

- JSON Parsing: The project supports parsing of JSON data structures, handling complex nested structures, arrays, and key-value pairs.
- Multi-Language Definition Generation: Automatically generates Java, C#, YAML, and MySQL definitions based on the parsed data structure. The generated files include class definitions, properties, and database table structures, ready for use in different development environments.
- Template Extension: The project features a flexible template system, allowing users to customize file generation templates to meet the needs of different projects and teams.
- Language Extensibility: Not limited to Java and C#, the tool can easily extend support for other programming languages, providing an open plugin architecture.
- Visual Configuration: Offers a user-friendly graphical interface for easy configuration of parsing rules and generation options, reducing the complexity of manual operations.

## Use Cases

- Cross-Platform Development: Suitable for projects involving multiple programming languages and data storage across different platforms.
- Data Structure Consistency: Ensures consistency between data structures in different languages, avoiding errors caused by manual definition.
- Rapid Prototyping: Used in the early stages of a project to quickly generate prototype code and data table definitions in various languages.
